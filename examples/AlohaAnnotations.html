<h1>Aloha</h1>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloha" target="_blank" class="external">aloha</a> derives from the Proto-Polynesian root <i>*qalofa</i>. It has cognates in other Polynesian languages, such as Samoan alofa
and Māori aroha, also meaning "love."</p>
<p><a href="http://aloha-editor.com/">Aloha Editor</a> is the word's most advanced browser based Editor made with aloha passion.</p>
<p>A folk etymology claims that it derives from a compound of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii" target="_blank" class="external">Hawaiian</a> words alo meaning "presence", "front", "face", or "share"; and
ha, meaning "breath of life" or "essence of life." Although alo does indeed mean "presence" etc., the word for breath is spelled with a macron
or kahakō over the a (hā) whereas the word aloha does not have a long a.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Before contact with the West, the words used for greeting were welina and anoai. Today, "aloha kakahiaka" is the phrase for "good
morning." "Aloha ʻauinalā" means "good afternoon" and "aloha ahiahi" means "good evening." "Aloha kākou" is a common form of "welcome to all."</p>
<p>In modern Hawaiʻi, numerous businesses have aloha in their names, with more than 3 pages of listings in the Oʻahu phone book alone.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Arguably the most famous historical Hawaiian song, "Aloha ʻOe" was written by the last queen of Hawaii, Liliʻuokalani.</li>
	<li>The term inspired the name of the ALOHA Protocol introduced in the 1970s by the University of Hawaii.</li>
	<li>In Hawaii someone can be said to have or show aloha in the way they treat others; whether family, friend, neighbor or stranger.</li>

Singapore police arrest death penalty book author

Singapore police arrested British author and journalist Alan Shadrake one day after the launch of his book about the country's use of the death penalty.
Shadrake, 75, was arrested on Sunday morning at a hotel in Singapore and taken into custody by police on charges of criminal defamation, in response to a complaint lodged by the city-state's Media Development Authority (MDA) over the contents of his new book, Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock. Separately, the Attorney-General served Shadrake with an application for an order of committal for contempt of court, accusing him of "cast[ing] doubt on the impartiality, integrity, and independence" of Singapore's courts through his book.
Shadrake's latest book discusses alleged "double standards" in the country's application of the death penalty, and contains interviews with local human rights activists, lawyers, and former police officers, including retired Changi Prison executioner Darshan Singh; Singh later claimed that he had been "tricked" into the interview. In earlier media comments, Shadrake stated that he expected "trouble" but no concrete action from authorities over his book, lest they draw even more attention to its claims. Retailers took his book off shelves after inquiries by the MDA; a spokesman for the MDA stated that the book was not banned, but suggested that booksellers "seek legal advice to ensure that the books they sell do not contravene Singapore laws".
Shadrake has written for a variety of newspapers, including The Daily Telegraph of London as well as the New Straits Times of neighbouring Malaysia. His previous book, The Yellow Pimpernels, told the tale of various attempts to escape from East Germany over the Berlin Wall. If convicted, he faces a two-year imprisonment and a fine.

        </span>, and Susannah Darwin (née Wedgwood). He was the grandson of Erasmus Darwin on his father’s side, and of Josiah Wedgwood on his mother’s side. Both families were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a freethinker, made a nod toward convention by having baby Charles baptised in the Anglican Church. Nonetheless, Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother, and in 1817, Charles joined the day school, run by its preacher. In July of that year, when Charles was eight years old, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus attending the nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a boarder.
     </p>
     <p>
       Darwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire. In the autumn, he went with Erasmus to the University of Edinburgh to study medicine, but was revolted by the brutality of surgery and neglected his medical studies. He learned taxidermy from John Edmonstone, a freed black slave who told him exciting tales of the South American rainforest. This experience gave him evidence that “Negroes and Europeans” were closely related despite superficial differences in appearance.
